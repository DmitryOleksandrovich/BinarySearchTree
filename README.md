# Binary Search Tree
Binary Tree : A data structure in which we have nodes con足tain足ing data and two ref足er足ences to other nodes, one on the left and one on the right.
###Operations:

Binary search trees support three main operations: insertion of elements, deletion of elements, and lookup (checking whether a key is present).

* Insert(int n) : Add a node the tree with value n. Its O(lgn)
